# CryoET + AI Data Portal

A Pydantic-validated metadata schema, a directory-walking catalog scanner, a FastAPI read API, and a TanStack Start + Material UI frontend for the CryoET + AI project. The portal answers one question across both the experimental and simulation arms of the project: **which conditions have we covered, and which still need cryoET imaging, simulation, or both?**

> **Status: draft / proposed.** Schema fields and conventions are still evolving as researchers start authoring metadata against it.

## Repository map

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/cryoet_schema/` | Authoritative Pydantic schema, JSON Schema generators, and the `validate` CLI. |
| `src/cryoet_catalog/` | Directory-walking scanner that builds the catalog DB from `sample.toml` + `acquisition.toml` + MDOC/MRC headers. Includes the FastAPI read API under `src/cryoet_catalog/api/`. |
| `frontend/` | React + TanStack Start + Material UI app that reads from the FastAPI server. |
| `deploy/` | Docker, Kubernetes/OpenShift manifests, nginx config, and the deployment guide (`deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md`). |
| `templates/` | Starter `sample.toml`, `acquisition.toml`, and directory skeletons, containing the TOML files in the expected locations, for new experimental (cryoET) and simulation (MD + synthetic cyroET) samples. |
| `docs/data_organization.md` | The on-disk layout and TOML metadata authoring guide for researchers. |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System architecture overview. |
| `.claude/plans/` | Implementation plans, including the catalog scanner plan. |
| `pyproject.toml` / `pixi.lock` | PyPI dependencies (`[project]`), and pixi config (`[tool.pixi.*]`). |

For the schema itself, see `src/cryoet_schema/schema_info.md` (human reference) and `src/cryoet_schema/schema.py` (Pydantic source of truth).

## Development

**Note:** This setup guide assumes you are working on machine with access to the Janelia file system.

1. [Install pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/installation/).
2. From the repo root, run `pixi install` to materialize the Python environments.

The frontend's Node deps are installed automatically the first time you run `pixi run frontend` (and re-run only when `package.json` / `package-lock.json` change). You don't need a separate `npm install` step.

3. Create the database. Pass the path to the data root via the CATALOG_DATA_ROOT env variable. This will scan the samples at that path and create a SQLite database called `cryoet_catalog.db` in your repo root.

```
CATALOG_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data pixi run scan --init
```

To also pre-generate tomogram thumbnails, set `CATALOG_THUMBNAIL_DIR` to a writable directory (or pass `--thumbnail-dir`). A plain rescan auto-heals a wiped cache; `--force` fully rebuilds it.

```
CATALOG_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data CATALOG_THUMBNAIL_DIR=/path/to/thumbnails pixi run scan --init
```

4. The portal has two processes: the FastAPI backend (reads the catalog DB) and the TanStack Start frontend (server-renders + hydrates a React app, proxying `/api` to FastAPI). Run them in two terminals.

**Terminal 1 — API:**
```
CATALOG_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data CATALOG_THUMBNAIL_DIR=/path/to/thumbnails pixi run api
```
Serves `http://localhost:8000`. Swagger UI at `/docs`.

> **No hot-reload.** The API runs with `--no-reload` (single worker). Neuroglancer's in-process HTTP server is incompatible with uvicorn's `--reload` mode, which tries to bind a second HTTP server on the same port.

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```
pixi run frontend
```
Open the data portal at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Alternate port

If port 8000 is taken, pass uvicorn flags through to use an alternate port. You can also change the IP binding:
```
pixi run api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8034
```

If you change the backend host/port, you will also need to point the frontend to it. The frontend reads its dev-server settings from `frontend/.env.local` (gitignored). Create it like this:

```
# Backend the /api proxy points to (default: http://localhost:8000)
API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:8034

# Port the Vite dev server listens on (default: 3000)
FRONTEND_PORT=3030
```

### Neuroglancer configuration

The "View in Neuroglancer" feature starts an in-process HTTP server inside the API process. It listens on its own port, separate from the API port, and is **not** behind nginx — the browser connects to it directly.

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEUROGLANCER_BIND_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0` | IP address the Neuroglancer server binds to. |
| `NEUROGLANCER_PORT` | `8050` | Port the Neuroglancer server listens on. Must be published separately from the API port; the browser connects to this port directly (not through nginx). |
| `NEUROGLANCER_MAX_VIEWERS` | `8` | Maximum number of concurrent viewers held in the LRU registry. |
| `DASHBOARD_HOSTNAME` | _(unset)_ | Overrides the hostname in Neuroglancer viewer URLs. Use in deployments where the server-side host differs from what the browser sees. |

The API must run as a **single worker with `--no-reload`** because the Neuroglancer server is process-global. Running multiple workers or hot-reloading would attempt to bind a second HTTP server on the same port.

## Production deployment

For Kubernetes deployment, see [deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md](./deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Testing Docker deployment locally

This models the production deployment using local Docker services. Nginx is the only port exposed to the host and proxies `/api/*` to FastAPI and everything else to the frontend SSR server.

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. Create a `.env` file in the repo root:

```
CATALOG_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data
NGINX_PORT=80            # optional, defaults to 80
```

2. Build all images:

```
docker compose build
```

3. Run the scanner to populate the database (writes into the `catalog-db` Docker volume):

```
docker compose --profile scan run --rm scanner
```

`--profile scan` activates the scanner service, which is excluded from the default `docker compose up` because in production it will run as a Kubernetes CronJob. `run --rm` starts it as a one-shot container and removes it when it exits.

4. Start the stack:

```
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost` (or `http://localhost:<NGINX_PORT>` if you changed the port). The API and frontend ports (8000 and 3000) are internal to the Docker network and not accessible from the host.

### Resetting after schema changes

The SQLite database persists in the `catalog-db` named volume across restarts. If the ORM schema has changed since the DB was created (new columns, renamed enums), the API will return 500 errors. Fix by wiping the volume and rescanning:

```
docker compose down -v
docker compose --profile scan run --rm scanner
docker compose up
```

## Schema authoring & validation

For researchers writing `sample.toml` / `acquisition.toml`, the authoring guide is in **[`docs/data_organization.md`](docs/data_organization.md)**. Quick commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pixi run validate {sample_dir}` | Validate `sample.toml` and all `acquisition.toml` files under a sample directory. |
| `pixi run json-schema` | Regenerate `src/cryoet_schema/schema.json` and `acquisition.schema.json` from the Pydantic models. Run after any change to `schema.py`. |
| `pixi run test` | Run the test suite. |
