# OpenShift Deployment

This guide covers deploying the CryoET catalog portal to an OpenShift cluster
using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).

## Prerequisites

- An OpenShift cluster with `oc` access
- A cluster router (`openshift-ingress`) serving a TLS certificate for your
  hostname — the application relies on the router for edge termination and does
  not manage its own TLS secret
- Container images pushed to your registry (see
  [GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/build-images.yml))
- A way to mount the CryoET data tree into the cluster (see
  [Wiring up the data root](#wiring-up-the-data-root))

## Architecture

```
Route (ai-cryoet.int.janelia.org) — edge TLS, HTTP→HTTPS redirect
    |
    v
  nginx (8080)
    |  /api/*                      -> api      (8000)   FastAPI read API
    |  /v /neuroglancer /events ...  -> api      (8050)   in-process Neuroglancer
    |  everything else             -> frontend (3000)   TanStack Start SSR
    |
    v
  api  ──reads──>  catalog-data (read-only data tree)
       ──reads──>  catalog-db   (SQLite)        <──writes── scanner (CronJob)
       ──reads──>  thumbnails   (PNG cache)     <──writes── scanner (CronJob)
```

There are four runtime components plus one batch job:

| Component | Image | Port(s) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nginx` | `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged` | 8080 | Edge proxy. The only service behind the Route. |
| `api` | `ai-cryoet-api` | 8000, 8050 | FastAPI read API + in-process Neuroglancer server. |
| `frontend` | `ai-cryoet-frontend` | 3000 | Server-rendered React app. |
| `scanner` | `ai-cryoet-scanner` | — | CronJob: walks the data tree, rebuilds the DB + thumbnails. |

```

Copy `config.env.example` to `config.env` and fill in real values. `config.env`
is gitignored and must not be committed.

## Wiring up the data root

The scanner reads a large, **pre-existing** data tree (e.g.
`/groups/cryoet/cryoet/data/scratch/data`) and the API reads the same tree to
serve previews and launch Neuroglancer. Unlike the SQLite DB and the thumbnail
cache — which the app creates from scratch — this data already lives on storage
your cluster administrators manage.

In Kubernetes a pod can only read storage that has been explicitly handed to it
through a **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** — a named request for storage. *Where*
that storage physically lives (an NFS export, a `/groups` mount, etc.) is
configured by the cluster/HPC team, not by these manifests.

`deploy/k8s/base/storage.yaml` declares a PVC named **`catalog-data-pvc`** as a
placeholder. Before deploying, take this question to the HPC/OpenShift team:

> *"How do we make `/groups/cryoet/cryoet/data/scratch/data` readable from pods
> in the `ai-cryoet` namespace, and what should the PVC be called?"*

They will typically do one of:

- **Bind `catalog-data-pvc` to a statically-provisioned PersistentVolume** that
  points at the existing export. In this case keep the PVC name as-is and they
  fill in the `storageClassName` / `volumeName` to match their PV.
- **Hand you an existing PVC name.** In that case either rename it to
  `catalog-data-pvc`, or change `claimName: catalog-data-pvc` to their name in
  `api.yaml` and `scanner.yaml`.

Whatever path is mounted **must equal** `CATALOG_DATA_ROOT` in `config.env` and
the `mountPath` for the `catalog-data` volume in `api.yaml` and `scanner.yaml`
(all three default to `/groups/cryoet/cryoet/data/scratch/data`). The scanner
records absolute paths under this root and the API validates reads against it,
so they must agree exactly.

The other two volumes (`catalog-db-pvc`, `thumbnails-pvc`) are created and
populated by the app and are shared between the API pod and the scanner pod, so
they use `ReadWriteMany`. Confirm with the HPC team that the default storage
class supports `ReadWriteMany` (NFS/CephFS do); if not, set an RWX-capable
`storageClassName` on those PVCs.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp deploy/k8s/overlays/production/config.env.example deploy/k8s/overlays/production/config.env
```

Edit `config.env`:

- `CATALOG_DATA_ROOT` — the in-cluster mount path of the data tree (must match
  the volume mountPath; see above)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — the public URL of the portal
- The remaining values rarely change from the template.

This app has no database password, user accounts, or SMTP credentials, so there
is no `secrets.env` — only the non-sensitive `config.env`.

### 2. Create the namespace

```bash
oc apply -f deploy/k8s/overlays/production/namespace.yaml
```

### 3. Create the image pull secret for ghcr.io

The container images are hosted on GitHub Container Registry and require
authentication. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
(classic) with the `read:packages` scope, then create the pull secret:

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry ghcr-credentials \
  --docker-server=ghcr.io \
  --docker-username=<github-username> \
  --docker-password=<PAT> \
  -n ai-cryoet
```

> **Tip:** To avoid the PAT expiring and breaking pulls, consider a GitHub App
> or a machine account with a long-lived token, or sync the credential from a
> vault with [External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/).

### 4. TLS

The Route in `deploy/k8s/base/routes.yaml` uses edge TLS termination without specifying
a certificate, so the cluster router serves its own configured certificate for
the hostname. No per-application TLS secret is needed. For a custom certificate,
extend the Route `spec.tls` block with `certificate`/`key`/`caCertificate` or use
`externalCertificate` (OpenShift 4.16+).

### 5. Preview the generated manifests

```bash
oc kustomize deploy/k8s/overlays/production
```

### 6. Deploy

```bash
oc apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/production
```

### 7. Populate the catalog (first run)

On a fresh deploy the SQLite DB does not exist yet, so the API serves an empty
catalog (and some pages may error until the first scan completes). Trigger the
scanner immediately rather than waiting for the next hourly run:

```bash
oc -n ai-cryoet create job --from=cronjob/scanner scanner-initial
oc -n ai-cryoet logs -f job/scanner-initial
```

### 8. Verify

```bash
# All pods running
oc -n ai-cryoet get pods

# API logs
oc -n ai-cryoet logs -l app=api

# Route admitted
oc -n ai-cryoet get route cryoet
```

Then open `https://ai-cryoet.int.janelia.org`.

## Neuroglancer in production

"View in Neuroglancer" starts an HTTP server *inside* the API process on port
8050. The frontend re-roots the viewer URL onto the page origin (it drops the
host and port the API reports), so the Neuroglancer paths must be reachable
through nginx on the same origin as the portal. The nginx ConfigMap in
`deploy/k8s/base/nginx.yaml` proxies Neuroglancer's fixed root paths (`/v`,
`/neuroglancer`, `/events`, `/state`, `/action`, `/volume_response`,
`/credentials`) to `api:8050` for exactly this reason.

Because the Neuroglancer server is process-global, the API **must** run as a
single replica with a single uvicorn worker (the image is built this way). Do
not scale the `api` Deployment above 1.

## Updating the Application

Pin specific image tags in the overlay's `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
images:
  - name: ghcr.io/janeliascicomp/ai-cryoet-api
    newTag: v1.0.0
  - name: ghcr.io/janeliascicomp/ai-cryoet-frontend
    newTag: v1.0.0
  - name: ghcr.io/janeliascicomp/ai-cryoet-scanner
    newTag: v1.0.0
```

Then `oc apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/production`. Pushing a `v*.*.*` git tag builds and
publishes all three images (see the workflow).

## Adding a New Environment

Create a new overlay directory referencing the same base:

```bash
mkdir -p deploy/k8s/overlays/staging
```

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: ai-cryoet-staging

resources:
  - ../../base
  - namespace.yaml

configMapGenerator:
  - name: cryoet-config
    envs:
      - config.env

generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Events and status for a pod
oc -n ai-cryoet describe pod <pod-name>

# CronJob run history
oc -n ai-cryoet get jobs

# Run the scanner on demand
oc -n ai-cryoet create job --from=cronjob/scanner scanner-manual

# Route status (admitted, host, TLS)
oc -n ai-cryoet describe route cryoet

# Inspect the catalog DB inside the API pod
oc -n ai-cryoet exec deploy/api -- ls -la /db /thumbnails
```

**API returns 500s after a schema change.** The SQLite DB in the `catalog-db`
volume predates the current ORM schema. Re-run the scanner; if it still fails,
the volume can be wiped (delete and recreate `catalog-db-pvc`) and rescanned —
the DB is fully rebuildable from the data tree.

**Scanner sees no data / empty catalog.** The `catalog-data` volume is not
mounted at the path the scanner expects. Confirm `CATALOG_DATA_ROOT`, the volume
`mountPath`, and what the HPC team actually exported all point at the same tree
(see [Wiring up the data root](#wiring-up-the-data-root)).
