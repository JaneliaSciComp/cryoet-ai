Test fixtures for the catalog scanner.

The fixture tree mirrors the canonical two-arm data root:

    fixtures/
      Experimental/
        sample_chromatin/            # experimental cryoET sample (data_source=experimental)
          sample.toml
          Position_86/ ...           # acquisition with acquisition.toml + tomogram + annotation
          Position_87/ ...           # Frames-only acquisition (no acquisition.toml)
      MdSimulation/
        SingleMolecule/
          sample_simulation/         # simulation sample (data_source=simulation, dataset_type=single_molecule)
            sample.toml              # dataset_type is DERIVED from the SingleMolecule/ dir, not authored
            MdRuns/
              run_001/md_run.toml    # MD-run metadata (id = folder name)
            SyntheticCryoET/
              sim_acq_01/            # acquisition nested under SyntheticCryoET/
                acquisition.toml     # references run_001 via [md_source]
                SyntheticCryoET/synth_tomo_1/recon.mrc
                Reconstructions/Annotations/synth_ann_1/metadata.json

``data_source`` and ``dataset_type`` are derived from the top-level arm
directory (``Experimental/`` vs ``MdSimulation/<SubDir>/``) by
``schema.layout.infer_arm`` during discovery; they are no longer authored in
``sample.toml``.
